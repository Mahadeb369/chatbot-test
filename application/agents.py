        "- **Campaign Dates** (e.g., '1st Jan 2025 to 30th Jan 2025')\n"
        "- **Location Criteria** (e.g., 'Bellandur, Kalamandir')\n"
        "- **Budget Constraints** (e.g., 'lower than 10 lakh per month' or 'total budget is 20 lakh')\n"
        "- **Media Type Preferences** (e.g., '40% for Skywalks, 60% for Hoardings')\n\n"

        "### **Step 2: Identify Query Type and Processing Strategy**\n"
        "1. **Standard Availability Query:**\n"
        "   - Extract campaign dates, location, and budget constraints.\n"
        "   - Query **Availability Check Agent** to get available spaces for the requested dates.\n"
        "   - Query **Location Selection Agent** to filter spaces based on location criteria.\n"
        "   - Query **Finance Agent** to apply budget filtering.\n\n"

        "2. **Budget Allocation Query:**\n"
        "   - If the query contains a total budget with allocation percentages (e.g., '40% for Skywalks, 60% for Hoardings'), distribute the budget accordingly.\n"
        "   - Query **Availability Check Agent** and **Location Selection Agent** to retrieve relevant media units.\n"
        "   - Apply budget constraints using **Finance Agent** to ensure proportional allocation.\n\n"

        "### **Step 3: Process Agent Responses and Merge Results**\n"
        "- Ensure locations appear in **both Availability and Location agent results**.\n"
        "- Apply **Finance Agent** constraints to ensure final selections fit within budget.\n"

        "### **Step 4: Generate a Structured JSON Response**\n"
        "1. **Ensure the JSON response always contains the correct structure.**\n"
        "{\n"
        "  \"available_locations\": [\n"
        "    {\n"
        "      \"site\": \"<Site>\",\n"

        "      \"availabilityStatus\": \"Available Immediately\" or \"Available after [date]\",\n"
        "      \"remarks\": \"<Remarks or empty string if null>\"\n"
        "    }\n"
        "  ],\n"

        "    }\n"
        "  ]\n"
        "}\n\n"

        "### **Step 5: Strictly Ensure Final Summary Format**\n"
        "**After generating the structured JSON response, ALWAYS provide a Final Summary in this format:**\n\n"
        "**Final Summary:**\n"
        "1. **Total Available Locations:** X\n"
        "2. **Media Types Considered:** Skywalks, Hoardings\n"
        "3. **Budget Applied:** Rs. XX,XX,XXX (as per constraints)\n"
        "4. **Best Available Locations:**\n"
        "   - **Site:** <Site ID> | **Material Code:** <Material Name>\n"
        "   - **Rate Card:** Rs. <Rate Amount>\n"
        "   - **Location:** <Main Location> | **Sub Location:** <Specific Area>\n"
        "   - **Landmark:** <Landmark if available>\n"
        "   - **Availability:** Available Immediately / Available after <Date>\n"
        "   - **Remarks:** <Additional Notes>\n"
        "5. **Budget Allocation Breakdown:**\n"
        "   - **Skywalks:** Rs. <Allocated Budget> (XX% of Total)\n"
        "   - **Hoardings:** Rs. <Allocated Budget> (XX% of Total)\n\n"

        "**⚠️ IMPORTANT:**\n"
        "- **Always start the human-readable summary with `Final Summary:`**\n"
        "- **Ensure the summary follows the exact point-by-point structure above.**\n"
        "- **NEVER skip the Final Summary, even if no locations are available.** Instead, return a message like:\n"
        "  - 'No available locations match the requested criteria.'\n"
        "  - 'The budget is too restrictive; consider adjusting it.'\n"
        "  - 'The requested sites are already booked during the campaign period.'\n\n"

        "### **Step 6: Processing Guidelines**\n"
        "- **Dynamically interpret different query types.**\n"
        "- **Maintain JSON output consistency.**\n"
        "- **Ensure the final summary is concise, well-structured, and easy to understand.**\n"
        "- **STRICT REQUIREMENT:** Always conclude your response with the section header '**Final Summary:**' followed by a clear, descriptive summary of the results. This header is mandatory and should not be omitted under any circumstances.\n"
